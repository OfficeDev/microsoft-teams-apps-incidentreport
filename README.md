Reporting and management of incidents in an organization is often a manual process ripe for some efficiency gains. Users rely on chat based messaging, e-mail and/or other ad-hoc channels to inform necessary parties about new incidents. Additionally, the information isn't easily audit-able for root cause analyses/postmortems due to transient or one-off nature of e-mail or chat based messaging systems.

The Incident Reporter bot in Microsoft Teams, helps you to easily and quickly respond to, report and document incidents which helps in dealing with an incident with alacrity. The key features of this bot include:
- Automated collection of the time, date and location of every incident
- Customizable incident reporting form based on your workplace needs
- Incidents reports in specialists team which allows for quick collaboration and notification to the relevant stakeholders to track it to completion
